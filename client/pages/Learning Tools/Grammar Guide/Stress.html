<p>English is a <strong>stress-timed</strong> language - words have their own patterns of stress which are not regular. There is always <strong>one</strong> syllable in a word which is more important (slightly louder and longer) than the others. If you get the stress in the wrong place, people can misunderstand you.</p>

<p>The stressed syllable is in <span class="gg-boldblue">blue</span>:</p>
