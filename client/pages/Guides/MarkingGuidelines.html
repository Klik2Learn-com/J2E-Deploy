						<h2>Tutor Instructions</h2>
						<p>The purpose of the English Skills Test is to grade overseas students according to their English language ability on the CEFR scale (Common European Framework of Reference.)  The English Skills Test does <b>not</b> provide an English language certificate. This guide gives you a brief explanation of the marking criteria for the English Skills Tests.</p> 

						<p>Students are assessed on all four skills; reading, writing, listening and speaking.</p> 

						<ul>
							<li><b>Reading assessments:</b> students read a series of graded passages and answer questions on them. Based on the number of correct responses, these are marked automatically and students are given a score. They will only proceed to the next passage if they achieve the cut - off score. Tutors don’t need to mark these but you may need to refer to the reading levels when choosing the final CEFR grade.</li> 

							<li><b>Listening assessments:</b> students listen to a series of graded passages and answer questions on them. Based on the number of correct responses, these are marked automatically and students are given a score. They will only proceed to the next passage if they achieve the cut - off score. Tutors don’t need to mark these but you may need to refer to the reading levels when choosing the final CEFR grade.</li> 

							<li><b>Speaking assessments:</b> tutors <b>are</b> required to mark speaking assessments. Students listen to pre-recorded, graded questions, and are given a minimum time to record their responses. They have the option to quit when they feel the questions are too difficult. Ideally, tutors should listen to each response, however, in the case of a stronger student, you may decide on their level before you reach the end of the recording. </li> 

							<li><b>Writing assessments:</b> tutors <b>are</b> required to mark writing assessments. Students choose one of two tasks, where a minimum word requirement has been stipulated. This has been devised to encourage students to produce as much English as they can, to help you assess them effectively. Writing task 1 is designed for lower level students; A1 to A2, and task 2 for B1 upwards, however, students can choose whichever task they wish.</li> 

							<li><b>Mixed levels:</b> as you mark, you may find that the levels are different, for example, A2 reading but B1 speaking, however, at the end of the assessments, you will need to give an overall level. Use your experience as a tutor to decide the most appropriate level for that student. If you’re unsure about any of the assessments, you  have the option to email one of the senior assessors, who will be able to advise you.</li> 

							<li><b>Exemplars and marking criteria:</b> in order to help you, several writing exemplars and levelling criteria have been provided to illustrate the decision making process.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Finally, you can mark in any order to wish, and there is always the option to go back and change a level, if you feel you’ve misjudged a student. Alternatively, you can email klik2learn and they will be able to change this for you.</p>

						<h2>English Skills Test Marker Requirements</h2>
						<p>As part of our expanding client base, we require ESOL tutors to mark and assess a large number of overseas students. This will be completed online and students will receive an indication of their overall English language level and a level for each language skill. The Listening and Reading Assessment are marked automatically and tutors are required to mark Writing and Speaking. Given the large number of students we require the following:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>CELTA or equivalent qualified tutors with some experience of marking and assessing.</li>
							<li>Minimum availability of 5 hours per week although hours cannot be guaranteed.</li>
							<li>Tutors to mark and assess approximately 15-20 students per hour (2 assessments per student).</li>
							<li>The ability to work remotely and independently and to keep to strict deadlines.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Subject to demand, additional hours may be available. We require a prompt turn-around of assessments. Please indicate below the number of hours you would be available to mark:</p>

						<h2>Writing Exemplars</h2>
						
						<h3>A1 &ndash; Lower range</h3>
						<blockquote><h4>Sample:</h4><p>&lsquo;I like Edinburgh and I like football I don&rsquo;t like cooking and I don&rsquo;t work hospital I like my brothe&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
						
						<h4>Comments</h4>
						<p>Letters are correctly formed and the learner demonstrates correct use of upper/lower case. The learner does not appear to be familiar with cursive writing. </p>

						<p>The learner seems to understand the concept of a sentence. The first two consist of two clauses in each sentence, while the third has only one clause. Although the learner has only produced three sentences, they are correctly formed. The three sentences do not seem to be connected and simply seem to be part of a list of things that the learner likes. Within the first two sentences the learner only uses the connector &ldquo;and.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>There are no grammatical mistakes within the very limited grammatical range. The learner only uses the present simple tense with two negatives. Spelling is generally accurate with very minor errors which do not impede understanding.</p>

						<p>The learner appears to understand the concept of a sentence, but makes no use of full stops. The apostrophe is also used &ndash; once correctly but omitted once. </p>
						
						<p>The learner fulfils the criteria for working towards A1 but at the lower end of the range. </p>

						
						<h3>A1 &ndash; Upper range</h3>
						<blockquote><h4>Sample:</h4><p>&lsquo;I like Scotland because it claen county and peipole are friendly. I like snowing it look beatiflul and I like this swimming souna.</p>
						
						<p>I dislike about the wether because it clool for me I dislike snow hwen it stay long time because it look dirsty. I dislike nexdroo because he park his car at front of my house some time my car can&rsquo;t get in.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
						
						<h4>Comments</h4>
						<p>Letters are correctly formed, although the learner does not use cursive writing. </p>

						<p>The sentences largely involve two clauses linked by &ldquo;because&rdquo; and &ldquo;and&rdquo;. More variety of structure would be expected at A2 level.</p>

						<p>Although the learner appears to understand the concept of a sentence, there is some uncertainty about this as shown in the second and last sentences which should actually be two sentences each. The sentences seem to make up a list of likes and dislikes rather than development of a theme. </p>

						<p>The learner uses the present simple tense, the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; and a negative modal, but not always accurately. There are frequent grammatical errors &ndash; omission of third person singular &ldquo;s&rdquo;, omission of the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo;.</p>

						<p>Spelling is the main area of difficulty for this learner and requires the reader to pause and try to guess what is meant &ndash; &ldquo;claen&rdquo;, &ldquo;clool&rdquo; (cool, cloudy?), &ldquo;hwen&rdquo;, &ldquo;nexdoo&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p>

						<p>Aside from the uncertainty over sentences, punctuation is generally accurate. </p>

						<p>This learner has a slightly jagged profile in that literacy and grammar are ahead of spelling. However, a significant improvement would be made in a short time. The learner should be placed at the higher end of A1 level and rapid progress would be likely.</p>

						
						<h3>A2</h3>

						<blockquote><h4>Sample:</h4><p>&lsquo;The day of my wedding was an experience that was very important in my life. This day I was very happy to see my family and my husband&rsquo;s family enjoy our union. But I was also sad because it was the last day with my own family and I cried. This day I wear I very big dress, there was a lot of food and a lot of guess.</p></blockquote>

						<h4>Comments</h4>
						<p>Letters and numbers are formed correctly and consistently, and are used appropriately. Writing is cursive.</p>

						<p>The sentences are relatively complex for this level and generally accurate. The learner shows some variety of sentence structure but does not demonstrate great variation in the grammatical structures used. The learner demonstrates correct use of simple connectors: &ldquo;because&rdquo;, &ldquo;and&rdquo; and &ldquo;but&rdquo;. Other than these, she does not use the range of connectors that would be expected at B1 level.</p>

						<p>There is some attempt at logical development of the theme, although the writing is very short. </p>

						<p>In general, spelling and punctuation are accurate enough to be followed most of the time, except with the first sentence of what seems to be paragraph 2: &ldquo;but I was also sad&hellip;&rdquo;. The learner seems to understand &ldquo;but&rdquo; though she omits the capital letter. It may be a slight oversight on the part of the learner, but by not starting with a capital letter, it makes the reader wonder if this sentence is part of paragraph one or two. It would seem that the learner is unsure of paragraphing. It does not, however, impede understanding. </p>

						<p>There is also a problem with the punctuation of the final sentence which should actually be two separate sentences. Spelling is generally accurate and the minor error with &ldquo;guess&rdquo; does not impede understanding as the context makes meaning clear.</p>

						<p>Although the learner uses good sentence structures in paragraph 1, with a relative clause, throughout the writing, she repeatedly only uses the past tense of the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; and one other past tense, &ldquo;cried&rdquo;. There is some repetition of vocabulary: &ldquo;was&rdquo;, &rdquo;a lot of&rdquo;, &ldquo;this day&rdquo;. In some respects, vocabulary is above A2 level: &ldquo;union&rdquo;, &ldquo;guess&rdquo; (although the spelling is incorrect). However, there is not a sufficient range as would be expected at B1 level.</p>

						<p>As the learner has written a very short text, it is not easy to assess. However, on the basis of what has been written, she appears to be at the higher end A2 level.</p>

						
						<h3>B1 &ndash; Lower Level</h3>

						<blockquote><h4>Sample:</h4><p>&lsquo;The word &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; is to describe a thing, a term or a person attractive. Everyone likes look beautiful. When I was 10 years old, I complained to my mother that my teeth are not good. I hit my hands and shouted at her, but she was not angry. After 2 hours I had a shower. She came to my room and sat behind me. She explained: a person looks good, must be healthy. If illness with body, the results are look awful. You growth is normal and you are fit. I feel you are beautiful.</p>
						
						<p>Until now I have never forgetten my mother told me how to look good. I always mention my food to keep my healthy, and also do regular exercise to keep fit.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

						<h4>Comments</h4>
						<p>The learner uses the linkers &ldquo;and&rdquo; and &ldquo;but&rdquo;. It is unlikely that she would not know &ldquo;because&rdquo; given the complexity of the writing. Besides the basic linkers, she also uses a range of other connecting phrases: &ldquo;Until now&rdquo;, &ldquo;After (2 hours)&rdquo;, When (I was)&rdquo;. </p>

						<p>The learner writes with continuity developing the theme and shows awareness of paragraphing to some extent. However, the first paragraph should probably be split into two.</p>

						<p>Spelling and punctuation are generally accurate, but slightly confusing in the middle part after &ldquo;she explained&rdquo; to the end of the paragraph. Despite this, it is easily comprehensible. </p>

						<p>The learner demonstrates some basic sentence structures as well as some complexity and variation: &ldquo;When I was 10 years old&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;Until now I have never&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>

						<p>The learner makes some minor grammatical errors. For example, in the first sentence, she omits &ldquo;used&rdquo; after &ldquo;is&rdquo; and also the verb and relative pronoun in the second clause of the same sentence. She also makes some errors with use of vocabulary. It is unclear what she means by &ldquo;I hit my hands&rdquo; and &ldquo;she came and sat behind me&rdquo; sounds strange. One would expect her to sit next to or in front of her, not behind. </p>

						<p>The learner has a reasonably good grasp of collocations generally, although she occasionally uses some vocabulary inaccurately. She also demonstrates an awareness of more complex grammar than a learner at A2 level. The learner should work on grammatical accuracy, focussing particularly on relative clauses and conditional clauses. Placement should be at the lower end of B1 level.</p>

						
						<h3>B1 &ndash; Upper Level</h3>

						<blockquote><h4>Sample:</h4><p>&lsquo;One of the most important experience in my life is definetely the time when I moved to Scotland. I was only 17 year old that time and it was very dificult for me to leave all my friends and start new life. Actually the only reason I moved to Glasgow was because my family has been living here for 10 years. My mother decided that I will come to her and go to school. Finally I went to college for English course and really enjoyed it. I think this is one of the most important time in my life with many changes, meeting new culture and peopl.</p>
						
						<p>I think I have got really important experience even if I will go back home one day I could compare different countries and the education from another country is always useful.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

						<h4>Comments</h4>
						<p>The learner shows the ability to construct quite developed sentences using, for example, complex subjects in sentences 1 and 3 and a noun clause in sentence 4.</p>

						<p>There is continuity, though the first paragraph is rather long and could be split.</p>

						<p>There are only two spelling mistakes: &ldquo;definitely&rdquo;&nbsp;in line 2 and &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; in line 4. Both of these are minor. The last paragraph could be improved by a sentence break after &ldquo;experience&rdquo;; otherwise punctuation is excellent.</p>

						<p>This learner shows a jagged profile in that, as indicated above, his sense of structure is quite developed but is marred by some fairly elementary mistakes. Examples are uncertainty over plurals (&ldquo;year&rdquo;&nbsp;in line 3 and &ldquo;time&rdquo;&nbsp;towards the end of paragraph 1), omission of &ldquo;at&rdquo;&nbsp;in line 4 and &ldquo;a&rdquo; in line 6. Tense use is also rather limited: &ldquo;has&rdquo;&nbsp;rather than &ldquo;was&rdquo;&nbsp;in line 7; the present rather than past perfect continuous in line 8, and the unnecessary &ldquo;will&rdquo;&nbsp;in paragraph 2, line 2.</p>

						<p>It is possible that, since moving to Scotland from Poland at the age of 17, this learner&rsquo;s spoken English has developed in advance of his written English and this has allowed the embedding of some fairly elementary mistakes that are not so noticeable in speech. Placement should be at the upper end of B1 level.</p>

						
						<h3>C1 &ndash; Lower Level</h3>
						<blockquote><h4>Sample:</h4><p>&lsquo; I have studied sociology for 5 years at University in Poland. After that, I have worked for 6 months as a social worker. My wages were really low so I decided to go to Scotland.</p>
						
						<p>My first impressions were quite bad. I did not speak English at all. I did not understand workmates and people from my neighbourhood. It was very stresfull I wanted to come back, but I got over it. I met my boyfriend. I also changed my job. I have been working in a restaurant since 2007. I would like to come back </p>
						
						<p>to Poland but I have to improve my English level. It is really important to my.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

						<h4>Comments</h4>
						<p>There is appropriate paragraphing in terms of subject-matter, though there should either be a blank line between each paragraph or indentation. </p>

						<p>Spelling is perfect, with the exception of the very last word, though this is more likely to be a grammatical slip. The learner even revised the word &ldquo;neighbourhood&rdquo;, in line 7, from the US to the British form. </p>

						<p>The learner makes a good connection between paragraphs 1 and 2 &ndash; &ldquo;Scotland&rdquo;&nbsp;/ &ldquo;My first impressions&rdquo; and uses paragraph 3 as a conclusion.</p>

						<p>Tenses include an appropriate use of the present perfect continuous at the end of paragraph 2, though there is some uncertainty over the choice of tense in line 2. In fact, the original tense, the past simple, would be better.</p>

						<p>Verb use is confined to tenses. There is little evidence of non-finite forms, with the exception of infinitives. Participles or gerunds do not feature. </p>

						<p>Sentence structure is fairly limited. Where there is more than one clause these are linked only by &ldquo;and&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;but&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;so&rdquo;. </p>

						<p>With the exception of the uncertainty over tense in line 2, which is marginal, there are no grammatical errors.</p>

						<p>The learner is capable of writing clear and accurate text. Structures are adequate but not highly-developed. Her writing level is at the lower end of B1 level.</p>

						
						<h3>C1 &ndash; Upper Level</h3>

						<blockquote><h4>Sample:</h4><p>&lsquo;The question about how the weather can form or change our behaviour or personality is subject of several studies. Is it possible to explain the rational behaviour beetwen countries if it is consider the climate of these societies is other point in discussion.</p>
						
						<p>It&rsquo;s a fact that our habits change during the seasons; how we wear, what we eat and the kind of activities related to. In the summer, with sunny days the people like to do more activities outside and then are more sociable compare to during the winter when most of the activities are indoors and more restrictive to smalls groups.</p>
						
						<p>How long or how strong can be one summer can affect our behaviour because can change our habits. I think our personality is conform for factors such as social structures and cultural features which are kind stables nowadays, but however in the beginning they were building around geographic and climatic factors. Today the technology, the diversity and exchange of cultural habits are changing our views about life and the world.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

						<h4>Comments</h4>
						<p>Structure is logical to a certain extent. The learner should use a blank line between paragraphs, or indentation.</p>

						<p>There are some minor spelling mistakes. Punctuation is accurate.</p>

						<p>The learner constructs a clear and detailed argument. Sentences are perhaps too complex for her ability at the moment. The second sentence in the text might be seen as typical. What she is trying to produce is presumably something on the lines of, &ldquo;Whether it is possible to explain national behaviour differences between countries in terms of their climates is the other point for discussion.&rdquo; However, she has some way to go before being able to master the necessary structures.</p>

						<p>There is no need for a great range of tenses in this type of text. Sentences exhibit a variety of structures. Vocabulary is adequate for the task.</p>

						<p>The grammatical errors she makes tend to be at a fairly advanced level and result from her over-ambitious approach to structure. None of these impede understanding of her general argument.</p>

						<p>There is a clear example of expanding on ideas in the second paragraph, where the learner starts by stating that our habits change according to the seasons, in terms of clothes, food and activities. She then goes on to discuss the difference between summer and winter activities.</p>

						<p>Her conclusion, that technology and the increased interplay between different cultures are becoming more important than geographical and cultural habits, is an appropriate conclusion to the text.</p>

						<p>The errors she makes occur mainly at sentence level and, given that her approach is obviously ambitious, the placement is clearly at the upper end of C1.</p>

						
						<h3>C2</h3>
						<blockquote><h4>Sample:</h4><p>&lsquo;Climate affects us. This is not a matter of beliefs. It is a matter of facts. In this sense I completely agree with all the body of evidence carried out by psychologist all over the world since the decade of 1950 (although examples of this relationship can be found in researches dating back in X1Xth century even.)</p>
						
						<p>It has been largely reported that changes in temperature produce an increase with hear bit rate, segregation of adrenaline and other physiological changes that lead to an augmentation in the levels of irascibility. In the same way, an excessive temperature produces headaches and diminish the capacity of concentration and attention. </p>
						
						<p>On the other hand, climate modules the social habits of a group. That is, if a human settlement is located in a warm place, people tend to stay outdoors which makes them socialize more. This fact makes people from warm places be more open and cooperative than people who live in colder places. In this sense, climate has an impact in personality through culture.</p>
						
						<p>Summing up, it seems clear the role of climate in personality and behaviour.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

						<h4>Comments</h4>
						<p>The argument develops logically throughout the course of four properly-formatted paragraphs.</p>

						<p>There are occasional spelling mistakes, none of which impede communication. Punctuation is good, the second sentence in paragraph 3 being a good example. The learner correctly places commas after the introductory, &ldquo;That is&rdquo;, then between the two main clauses and before the concluding non-defining relative clause.</p>

						<p>The learner shows the ability to write complex sentences which are well-constructed.</p>

						<p>Structural range here is displayed at sentence level, and the learner shows a confident mastery of sentence grammar. Vocabulary is impressive, though perhaps at times showing a tendency towards over-sophistication. The middle lines of paragraph 2 are a good example of this: &ldquo;... other physiological changes that lead to an augmentation in the levels of irascibility.&rdquo; There is also occasional uncertainty; for example, &ldquo;modules&rdquo; in the opening line of paragraph 3 should be &ldquo;modifies&rdquo;.</p>

						<p>There are no significant grammatical errors.</p>

						<p>The text is logically constructed and well-argued throughout. The references to research in paragraph 1 indicate that the learner has an appropriate academic background for this subject area.</p>
