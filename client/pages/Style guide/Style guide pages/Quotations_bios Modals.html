					Charles Dickens – a famous English writer who lived from 1812-1870. He wrote stories and novels that are still being made into films and musicals today – <i>A Christmas Carol, Oliver Twist</i>. He experienced debt and poverty as a child. The character, Mr. Micawber, is said to be based on his own father. He was hugely popular in his lifetime in Britain and America not just for his 15 novels but for his live performances when he read extracts from them. As well as being the greatest novelist of the Victorian period he was a great social reformer and his novels raised issues like child labour, education and the law. He created some characters who are still remembered today. His character Scrooge from A Christmas Carol now means someone who is mean to others and hates spending money.
