But before he climbed Mount Everest — at the age of 65, he had to face a different kind of challenge: bullies at Eton College. When he <span id="entryanswer0" class=""><form class="textentry"><input type="text" name="userText" size="15" autocomplete="off" autofocus><input type="submit" value="OK"></form></span>, Fiennes was a good looking boy. At the time, it was considered normal to tease good looking boys and they taunted Fiennes.</p>

When he <span id="entryanswer2" class="textentry-disabled"></span> to the North Pole in 2000 he got frostbite. In 2003, he <span id="entryanswer3" class="textentry-disabled"></span> for take off from Bristol airport when he suffered a heart attack. Just four months later, he ran seven marathons in seven days on seven continents. His good looks worked for him in a positive way: Fiennes was once chosen for the role of James Bond.</p>

He was called “amazing,” “incredible,” and even “Sportsman of the Year.” As a kid however he was taunted for his “sticky-out ears” and lisp. When the swimmers <span id="entryanswer0" class=""><form class="textentry"><input type="text" name="userText" size="15" autocomplete="off" autofocus><input type="submit" value="OK"></form></span> some even teased him about his long arms which ultimately helped him to greatness. His coach Bob Bowman said, “Michael is the motivation machine — bad moods, good moods, nothing stops him.” While he <span id="entryanswer1" class="textentry-disabled"></span> for his first Olympics, Michael even went into the pool on Christmas Day. His story is an inspiration to bullied kids everywhere.</p>

When he <span id="entryanswer0" class=""><form class="textentry"><input type="text" name="userText" size="15" autocomplete="off" autofocus><input type="submit" value="OK"></form></span> his army training Harry’s pals called him the “Ginger Bullet Magnet.” His army career was a success.</p>
