						<p>The Mill at New Lanark was built in 1786 to <b>spin and weave cotton</b>. It’s earliest workers came from Glasgow and Edinburgh’s <b>poorhouses</b>. Later, Highlander’s affected by the <b>Highland Clearances</b> came to settle in the town. Working with the machinery could be dangerous and injuries were common.</p>
						
						<p>The Mill is said to be <b>haunted</b> by the workers that lived in the town. Videos in the visitor centre even feature a ghost that talks about her life in New Lanark!</p>
