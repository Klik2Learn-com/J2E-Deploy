				<p>1. International experts are calling for vitamin D to be added to food in Scotland. Scotland has a high number of people with <a draggable="false" href="#" title="Multiple Sclerosis" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="manual" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Multiple Sclerosis is a disease which affects the brain and spinal cord. It can cause problems with eyesight, muscle control, balance and numbness. Some people can live with it for many years. About 100,000 people in the UK have MS and 10,000 of them live in Scotland.">Multiple Sclerosis</a> – one of the highest levels in the world. Scots don’t get enough sunshine and a lack of vitamin D is caused by a lack of sunlight. For half the year, nobody living in Scotland gets enough UVB rays from the sun on their skin to make the vitamin D they need and many do not eat enough of the foods that contain it, such as oily fish.</p>

				<p>2. Professor George Ebers at Oxford University believes the evidence is now good enough to justify dosing the entire population with vitamin D. This month his team published evidence of a link between a lack of vitamin D and MS.</p>

				<p>3. It is a piece of strong scientific evidence which backs up the theory that people who do not get enough sunshine are more likely to get MS. In countries with year-round sunshine there are very low numbers of MS sufferers.</p>

				<p>"Now the question is, can we finally persuade the public health authorities?" said Ebers.</p>

				<p>7. Vitamin D is vital for the gut to absorb calcium. Low levels can cause the bone disease rickets. In <a draggable="false" href="#" title="Victorian Times" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="manual" data-placement="bottom" data-content="Victorian Times is the period when Queen Victoria was queen from 1837 to 1901. During this time there were many changes in society. The UK population increased, photography was invented and railways were built across Britain.">Victorian times</a>, when rickets was rife among the poor, children suffered softening of the bones and ended up with bow legs because their diet was so bad.</p>

				<p>8. In recent years rickets appears to have had a resurgence. The reason this time is a lack of vitamin D and there is speculation that children's indoor life, with computer games and TV, may be partly to blame.</p>

				<p>9. In the northern hemisphere, the sun is not strong enough in the winter. People are wrapped against the cold or mostly indoors and the body uses up stocks of vitamin D made in the summer.</p>

				<p>10. People with darker skins are at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency and so are those who stay fully covered because of their religious beliefs. Over-exposure to the sun is harmful but all of us need about 10 to 15 minutes a day to maintain adequate vitamin D levels.</p>
