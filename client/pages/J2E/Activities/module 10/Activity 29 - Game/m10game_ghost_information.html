	<h4>Queen Anne Boleyn</h4>
	<p>The ghost of Queen Anne is the most frequent visitor to the Tower. She had the misfortune to be one of Henry VIII’s wives. The king loved her very much which made his noblemen jealous. They decided to turn the King against her so they told him she had been unfaithful. She was taken to the Tower as a prisoner and killed in 1536.</p>

	<h4>Lady Jane Grey</h4>
	<p>King Edward VI declared Lady Jane Grey his heir to the throne. She was Queen for only nine days when Edward’s sister Mary removed her and sent her to the Tower. She was reluctant to give the order for Jane to be killed. However, when Jane’s father led a plot against Mary, she changed her mind and had Jane executed. On 12th February 1554, at the age of only 16, she was killed. In 1957, on that exact date a Tower guard heard a striking sound. He looked up and saw a white shape standing at the top of the tower.</p>

	<h4>Sir Walter Raleigh</h4>
	<p>Although he was eventually killed by James I, Walter Raleigh enjoyed much better living conditions than other prisoners.  His wife and two children lived with him in the Tower and the rooms they stayed in can still be seen in the same condition today. He made good use of his time and wrote a book called ‘The History of the World’ while he was in prison.</p>

	<h4>Thomas Becket</h4>
	<p>Thomas Becket was the Archbishop of Canterbury - the most powerful person in the church of England - in the 12th Century. He was a friend of King Henry II but the friendship didn’t last when Thomas began to stand up for the church and disagree with the king. He realised he was in danger and escaped to France for several years. When he returned, four of the king’s knights murdered him in Canterbury cathedral. A century later when the Tower was being built, it collapsed twice on exactly the same day - 23rd April - the day named after St George - the patron saint of England. People claimed to have seen the ghost of Thomas Becket so King Edward I named the Tower after him.</p>

	<h4>Guy Fawkes</h4>
	<p>Guy Fawkes was a soldier from Yorkshire who became an expert in explosives. In the early 17th century Catholics in England faced persecution and some thought the time was right for action against the government. They approached Guy Fawkes to lead the famous Gunpowder plot. They wanted to blow up the King, the Royal family and the ruling classes at the opening of Parliament in 1605. The plan failed. To this day Guy Fawkes’s daring plot is remembered on 5th November with firework displays and bonfires.</p>

	<h4>Arbella Stewart</h4>
	<p>Arbella Stewart married William Seymour, a relative of King James I. There was just one problem – she didn’t ask the King’s permission. She was arrested and William was sent to the Tower. She was not defeated however. She escaped dressed as a man and plotted to get William out of the Tower. They planned to escape to France but the plan went wrong. William made it to France and freedom but never saw Arbella again. She was sent back to the Tower and died in 1615.</p>

	<h4>Prince Edward</h4>
	<p>No-one knows for sure what happened to Prince Edward, aged nine and his brother Prince Richard, aged 12. Their uncle Richard wanted to take control of the country so had them taken to the tower. In the fifteenth century, two guards said they had seen the shadows of the two Princes going down the stairs holding hands and dressed in their nightshirts. Two centuries later the bones of two children were found in a chest and given a royal burial. Their deaths remain a mystery to this day.</p>

	<h4>Prince Richard</h4>
	<p>Records from the time show that Prince Edward was receiving medical treatment from a doctor so he may have died from illness or disease. There is no record for Richard and some people believe he survived. Later on, various people came forward claiming to be Prince Richard. Some people have suggested that he may have been hidden or given a new identity but we will never know exactly what happened to him.</p>
