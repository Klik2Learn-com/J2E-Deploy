						<p>Good morning. My name is Hannah Nelson. I'm sixteen years old and I'm from Belfast. I've been thinking about an important
							question ... how do you make peace permanent in Northern Ireland? Permanent peace, in our country, is not just a simple
							dream for me as a teenager today growing up in Northern Ireland. It's a sincere, genuine aspiration. I believe that
							enduring peace can only come about through true respect for others. We all have a right to express and celebrate our
							diverse cultures. We all have an obligation to value each other as individuals.</p>
						<p>As a sixteen year old I don't want to live in the past. I want to live for the future. I want to live in a country
							where it is not my religion that is important but my value as a person which is significant.</p>
						<p>It's important that we all have a unique identity: a choice in life to choose who and what we want to be. We are growing
							up in a world where we are taught to be tolerant. To live peacefully, we must put this into practice. We must accept
							our differences if we are to move forward.</p>
						<p>I think that my age group should be the focus. We are the ones who must build new relationships with people from different
							communities. Barriers need to be broken down. If we are to take away prejudice from young people's minds, we can create
							a society that can get on together - a peaceful society.</p>
						<p>Northern Ireland is my home. The reality is, it has a past. Often in Northern Ireland we hear about our past. People
							have many genuine stories and they are definitely what make our history so important. But truthfully, we should not
							let the past pull us apart and stop us from moving forward. Somehow we need to make a brighter future - a future that
							builds bridges and brings people together. We need to work together not apart. We need to listen to each other and
							we need to compromise. Most importantly we need to clearly value each other.</p>
						<p>Peace is not easy and it takes a lot of work to make it happen. I think that it is easy for some to sit back and hold
							on to the past. For peace to be an actual reality, however, we all need to take responsibility for the present. Our
							past, our future. It is all about time.</p>
						<p>It is in the present time that we really need to be responsible, accountable people and live to make a better future
							for ourselves. There is no time like the present. Now is the time to start to make permanent peace happen in Northern
							Ireland because we, the young people in this room want and deserve to live in peace. Northern Ireland is my home but
							the reality is - it has a future.</p>

						<p>The police have been attacked with petrol bombs in north Belfast as trouble flared for the second night. The marching
							season in Northern Ireland is a period of events from April to August. The high point is the 12th of July when Protestants
							march to commemorate a Protestant victory in 1690. But many Catholics see the marches as sectarian. Some marches pass
							through areas occupied mainly by Catholics.</p>
						<p>There was serious rioting on Friday night when 32 police officers and an MP were injured. Many families with children
							were caught up in the violence.</p>
						<p>Petrol bombs, bricks and fireworks were thrown at the police who responded with water cannons and baton rounds.</p>
						<p>A north Belfast MP was knocked unconscious after he was hit by a missile.</p>
