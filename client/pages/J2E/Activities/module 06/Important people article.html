		<p>Children still believe the Royal Family are the most important people in Britain, with the Queen coming top with British youngsters.</p>

		<p>Six hundred and fifty British school children were asked questions by leading child experts 'CHILDWISE'. Some people think that school children are becoming increasingly influenced by celebrities but children still think politicians and Royals <a draggable="false" href="#" title="" data-toggle="popover" role="button" tabindex="0"  data-trigger="manual" data-placement="bottom" data-content="scoring more highly">outrank</a> pop stars and sports personalities.</p>

		<p>David Cameron, Britain's Prime Minister since 2010*, and the Duke of Cambridge are more important than David Beckham according to the children. Even some of the most popular TV personalities didn't score as highly as you might expect. TV shows like The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, have millions of viewers. Children as young as eleven take part in these competitions but that didn't seem to influence children's opinions <a draggable="false" href="#" title="" data-toggle="popover" role="button" tabindex="0"  data-trigger="manual" data-placement="bottom" data-content="not very much">unduly</a>.</p>

		<p>Well known TV presenters Ant and Dec, were important to only 21 percent of children. Teenage <a draggable="false" href="#" title="" data-toggle="popover" role="button" tabindex="0"  data-trigger="manual" data-placement="bottom" data-content="adored by female fans">heartthrob</a> Harry Styles from the boy band One Direction received just 13 percent of the votes. Even the Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe seems to have lost his magic.</p>

		<p>Perhaps one of the most surprising results was the popularity of the Mayor of London - Boris Johnson*. He scored more highly than the superstar footballer David Beckham.</p>
