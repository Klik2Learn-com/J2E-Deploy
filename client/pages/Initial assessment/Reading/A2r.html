						&emsp;During World War 2 thousands of Polish soldiers and airmen came to live in Britain after they escaped from Poland. They fought through the war, but when it ended in 1945 the Soviet Union controlled Poland and many didn't want to return home. The British Government allowed them to stay and over 100,000 did. Most of them married local women. 
						<br><br>
						&emsp;In 2004 Poland became a member of the European Union. Poles were allowed to move to other countries and thousands of young people came to Britain to find work. At first, many of them worked on farms, picking crops, then went on to get jobs in bars and restaurants. Since then, some have started businesses and others have found new and better work. Some have returned to Poland and many have decided to stay here and make this country their home.
