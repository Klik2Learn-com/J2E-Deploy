						&emsp;The earliest settlement of South Asians in Britain dates back to the days of the British Empire. In the 19th century, British ships returning from India recruited local sailors to fill vacancies in their crews; such employment opportunities being common enough as sailing was a dangerous job and the mortality rate was high. British families returning home from India often brought servants with them. Indian students studied in British universities and ambitious young men came to pass the exams for the Indian Civil Service, which could only be taken in London. Indian companies sent representatives to Britain, and as the country prepared for independence in 1947, increasing numbers of Indian politicians came to London. During both world wars, units of the Indian Army worked and served alongside British troops. Some people from all of these groups chose to remain in Britain.

						&emsp;The end of the Second World War in 1945 was followed by Indian independence two years later, and the partition of what had been British India into India and Pakistan. Following this, migration from both countries to Britain increased. Manual workers, mainly from Pakistan, filled the nationwide labour shortage caused by the destruction of the war. In the late 1950s and 1960s, workers, mostly from the Indian part of the Punjab region, arrived to take up positions in the factories of the English midlands and the north. At the same time, medical staff found work in the National Health Service. This had been founded in the years after the war. Free access to medical care meant a greatly increased demand and a consequent need for more staff. In 1972, all Asians in Uganda were expelled by the dictator Idi Amin. Many had been involved in business there and some continued this type of employment in Britain. Two immigration laws, of 1962 and 1971, largely restricted any further primary immigration, although family members of existing immigrants were still allowed.
