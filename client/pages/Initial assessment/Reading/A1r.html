						&emsp;After 1870, Italians began to arrive in Scotland. They came from poor parts of Italy. Most of them sold ice cream in the streets of Glasgow and the other cities. Ice cream was new to Scotland and it was very popular. They worked many hours every day and didn't make much money, but some of them opened cafes. Later, their children and grandchildren opened Italian restaurants. Some Scottish Italians today still work in the food and drink business, but most have other jobs. Many have a holiday home in Italy and they see Scotland as their home.
