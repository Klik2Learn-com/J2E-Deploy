						&emsp;Only 12 miles of sea separate Scotland from Ireland so it isn't surprising that the two countries have a fair amount of common history. In fact the name ‘Scot’ comes from those people who crossed from Ireland into the West Highlands in the 5th century, and later conquered the whole country north of the River Forth. 
						<br><br>
						&emsp;When Scotland changed from a Roman Catholic to a Protestant country in 1560, this new form of Christianity didn’t make much progress in the Highlands, and the close links between the Catholics there and their counterparts in Ireland continued. In 1603, when the Scottish king, James VI, became king of England as well, he settled thousands of Protestants in Northern Ireland. One of the reasons was to break up the western Catholic fringe.
						<br><br>
						&emsp;In the 1840s there was famine in Ireland. Over a million people died and another million emigrated.
						<br><br>
						&emsp;Large numbers of these came to Glasgow. Relationships between the Irish Catholic immigrants and the native Scots were difficult. The Irish took the lowest-paid jobs and were accused of working for lower rates of pay. Today, although there are still tensions, especially in and around Glasgow, the two communities live side by side in relative harmony.
