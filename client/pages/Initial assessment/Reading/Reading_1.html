					<p>Twelve years ago we were living in Lahore. I was four years old and my dad was a chef in a hotel there. One day a letter arrived from my uncle Asif – he’s married to one of dad’s sisters. He was running a restaurant in Dundee and wondered if dad might be interested in coming to be a chef there. Asif knew that dad was a first rate chef so it made sense for both of them. He decided to go and after a couple of years, the rest of the family joined him. It was quite tough at first. I don’t remember much because I was only six at the time but I thought it was very cold. Now I’ve lived here for most of my life and things are different. I think of this as my home but I’m still Pakistani in some ways.</p>
