						&emsp;The first Chinese who settled in Britain were sailors. They entered through port cities such as London, Cardiff and Liverpool. This began to happen in the early 1800s. Around a hundred years later, Chinese people began to move into the restaurant business. Now there are over 7600 Chinese restaurants in Britain. However, this may not increase as restaurants serving other types of food move into an already crowded market. Today, the British Chinese community is the largest in Europe and many families have been here for a long time. 
						<br><br>
						&emsp;Compared to other ethnic groups, the Chinese are quite spread out. Although some cities, like London and Manchester, have a ‘Chinatown’, this is just an area with many Chinese shops and restaurants. It isn't where most Chinese people live. The Chinese also have a high rate of marriage outside their own community. Many are still employed in the restaurant business but a significant number have gone on to work in the professional jobs.
